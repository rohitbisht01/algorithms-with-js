#### Asymptotic Notation

    Big-O Notation - Worst case complexity => describes the complexity of an algorithm using algebric terms => expressed in terms of input
    Omega Notation - Base case complexity
    Theta Notation - Average case complexity

#### Objects and Big-O

    Insert - O(1)
    Remove - O(1)
    Access - O(1)
    Search - O(n)
    Object.keys() - O(n)
    Object.values() - O(n)
    Object.entries() - O(n)

#### Arrays and Big-O

    Insert/remove at end - O(1)
    Insert/remove at begining - O(n)
    Access - O(1)
    Search - O(n)
    Push/pop - O(1)
    Shift/unshift/concat/slice/splice - O(n)
    forEach/map/reduce/filter - O(n)
